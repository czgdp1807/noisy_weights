Noisy Weights
=============

This repository contains experiments(in the form of jupyter notebooks) to solve the problem of dataset shift which occurs when the training distirbution and test distribution are different. The model is expected to produce high uncertainty while testing when out of distribution is data given. The problem is solved by adding a very minor Gaussian noise to weights. The results so far seem to be satisfactory.
